To build the SIMD version: just make.

The makefile here works for gcc 4.2.1 and so is the source.

If you have a more up to date gcc 4.3.2 (like latest cygwin version)
then use the commented option in the makefile and uncomment the relevant
#ifdef in SWIFFTX.c

Play around with the Tester.c source to get various tests timing.
